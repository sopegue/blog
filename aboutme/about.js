  "I'm a student with a bachelor degree in computer science and currently studying a master in systems informations engineering. I do code, mostly website. I like learning and practicing by doing projects. If set up a project from the front end to the backend until deploying the project and having a project that works is called full stack, then I can call myself a full stack developper. I work mostly with javascript, html and css as programming languages, vue js & nuxt js as front-end framework, laravel as backend-end framework, Postgresql & Mysql as database, Microsoft azure for database deployment and management, heroku for the back-end deployment and Netlify for the front-end deployment. I use git and github for project version & continuous integrations management.",
